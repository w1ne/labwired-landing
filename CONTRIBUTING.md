# Contributing to LabWired Landing Page

Thank you for your interest in improving the LabWired landing page!

## Development Workflow

This repository follows **trunk-based development** on the `main` branch:
- **`main`**: Primary development branch. All PRs target this branch.
- **`feature/name`**: Short-lived feature branches for specific changes.

## Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Edit the HTML/CSS/JS files
3. Test locally by opening `index.html` in a browser
4. Open a PR against `main`

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Test all pages (`index.html`, `docs.html`, `demo.html`)
- Verify responsive design on mobile and desktop
- Check all links are working
- Validate HTML/CSS

## Code Standards

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Maintain consistent styling with existing design
- Optimize images and assets
- Test cross-browser compatibility
