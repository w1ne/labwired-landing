# LabWired

> The definitive hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment for autonomous agents.

LabWired provides bit-accurate hardware simulation for ARM (Cortex-M) and RISC-V architectures, focusing on peripheral-level determinism rather than just instruction speed. This enables deterministic CI pipelines for embedded firmware.
Libwired is a digital twin for IoT HW.

## Key Concepts
- **Peripheral-First Design:** Precise timing for DMA, RCC, GPIO, UART, etc.
- **Bit-Accurate Determinism:** Lockstep engine eliminates CI flakiness by decoupling simulated time from host time.
- **Agentic Interfaces:** Fully programmatic interaction via standard protocols like GDB and custom Agent APIs (JSON/YAML-based).
